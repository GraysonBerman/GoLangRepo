Parker and I (Grayson) decided to create a project using Go. 
My older brother told me about the internet of things (IoT) and how Go is used for a lot of the devices.
I'm interested in pursuing a career in IoT. 
I love toys and doo-dads. If I could make a keurig coffee machine that runs when I post a tweet saying 'make a cup', I would be so HAPPY.
I like creating convenience and efficiency, and those are two key parts of IoT design.
Also, Go programmers are in high-demand and are well paid! Who doesn't love a high-paying job out of college or early in their career?
