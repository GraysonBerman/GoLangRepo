I spent some time on reddit to get some information on how to start learning Go.
I got a lot of useful information from other redditors: e-books, tips, etc.
I started learning through a website called www.gobyexample.com

In order to run Go on OS X you need to download go packages and what not.
You can then compile and run through terminal. Super easy.

Go is really interesting. It looks like it was designed to make programming easier and easier to read.

I might load all of my codebyexample files up onto github too, but it may be too many unneccessary files.
