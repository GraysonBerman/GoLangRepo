Partial correcteness of while-loops
Exercise: What do the following two programs compute? What pre and postconditions can be used to formalise this?
Find a loop invariant and use it to prove the partial correctness of this program.

Program 1:    
while (i < 100 ) do
        y := y+x
        i := i+1  
    done
    
precondition: 0 <= i < 100
post condition: i >= 100

What is computed?
For each iteration, x is added to y.
It could be represented as a Riemann sum.

The loop invariants:
x does not change.

What changes
y = y + 100x
i>= 100




Program 2:
  while  (i < k ) do
        i := i+1 
        y := y*i
    done
    
pre conditions: 
0 <= i < k
k > 0
post conditions: 
i >= k
Invariants:
k = k
What is computed?
For each iteration, i is incremented by 1 and y is multiplied by i.
This occurs until i >= k.
It could be represented as a Riemann sum.
