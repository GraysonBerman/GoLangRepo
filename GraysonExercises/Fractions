1) To simplify, we only consider positive fractions. Define an equivalence relation ≡ on the set ℕ×ℕ such that the set ℕ×ℕ/≡ of equivalence classes is in bijective correspondence with positive fractions. 
  (Hint: ≡ needs to capture that, eg, in mathematics 1/3=2/6; this will correspond to (1,3)≡(2,6).[2])
2) Define an ARS (ℕ×ℕ,→) that has unique normal forms. Argue why your ARS has unique normal forms.
3) Explain how to add and multiply normal forms.
