1) To simplify, we only consider positive fractions. Define an equivalence relation ≡ on the set ℕ×ℕ such that the set ℕ×ℕ/≡ of 
   equivalence classes is in bijective correspondence with positive fractions. 
  (Hint: ≡ needs to capture that, eg, in mathematics 1/3=2/6; this will correspond to (1,3)≡(2,6).[2])
2) Define an ARS (ℕ×ℕ,→) that has unique normal forms. Argue why your ARS has unique normal forms.
3) Explain how to add and multiply normal forms.


1)
ax/bx -> a/b
simplify fractions by reducing them
a%b > 0
Using a%b >0 shows that the fraction can't be simplified further
This leaves only simplified fractions, which match with only one positive fraction.

2) Define an ARS (ℕ×ℕ,→) that has unique normal forms
(ℕ×ℕ,→)
(a,b) -> (a-1, b)
a < b
The two rules above make it so that every numerator is decremented by 1, so there is only one normal form for each number.
It also means that every normal form is unique (normal form a/b can only be reached by a+1/b)
a%b > 0
ax/bx -> a/b
The two rules above make it so that you only have simplified fractions

3)
To add and multiply normal forms:
a/b * c/d = ac/bd
multiplication of fractions
a/b * x = ax/b
Multiplication by a constant
a/b  +c/d = (da + cb)/bd
addition: get LCD and add the numerators above the LCD
