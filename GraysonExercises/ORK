Given the rules:
If the last letter is R you may add a K at the end 
A string of the form Ox may be rewritten to Oxx
You may replace any occurrence of RRR by K
You may erase any occurrence of KK

Describe an ARS with these rules:
R->RK
Ox->Oxx (where x is any letter)
RRR -> K
KK -> 

Possible reduction of ORRORR
ORRORR -> ORRRORRR using the rule Oxx->Oxx
ORRRORRR-> OKOK using the rule RRR-> K
OKOK -> OKKOKK using the rule Ox->Oxx
OKKOKK -> OO using the rule KK->

Can OK become OR?
This is not possible. There isn't a way to reduce K's into R's, only R's into K's and K's into nothing.
