I need to analyze the basic examples from earlier exercises and describe them in terms of a TRS.
Signature, variables, equations:
An equation is a pair (t,t′)∈TermΣ(X)×TermΣ(X)
terms = elements of an ARS



What is the signature/variable(s)/equation(s) for the string rewriting ARS?
Well each reduction is an equation:
aa->a would be an equation. The variable/terms are the a's. The signature is 

... TBC
