Two termination exercises below:

1)
Exercise: Show that whatever the test <TEST> the program below

while ub > lb + 1 do
begin r : = (ub + lb) div 2;
if <TEST> then ub := r else lb := r
end 


2) 
Exercise: Show that the two programs

while m =/= n do
  if m > n then m := m — n else n := n — m
and

while m =/= n  do
  if m > n then m : = m — n
  else begin h :=m; m :=n; n := h end
terminate. Are there any assumptions you need do make the argument work?

2) 
For the first program, we need to show that
