I asked my friend who graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering about Go.
He said that it's the most in demand scripting language.
I didn't know the difference between scripting and programming.
Scripts are written to automate tasks rather than having a user execute the tasks.

My sister, who works at Netflix, says that scripts are responsible for things like automatically renewing your subscription
and billing your credit card. 

Go is a common language for IoT. IoT is the Internet of things, or the way devices connect to other devices via the internet.
An example of IoT allowing people to turn their home's AC on from their cellphone by connecting their phone to their AC
(probably via a phone app.)

Go is a very in-demand and uncommon language, so it is one of the highest paid languages. I'm hoping that
knowing Go will help me secure a job because my resume SUCKS. LOL.
