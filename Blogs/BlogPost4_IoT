I asked my friend who graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering about Go.
He said that it's the most in demand scripting language.
I didn't know the difference between scripting and programming.
Scripts are written to automate tasks that occur at runtime rather than having a user execute the tasks. 

Go is a common language for IoT. IoT is the Internet of things, or the way devices connect to other devices via the internet.
An example of IoT allowing people to turn their home's AC on from their cellphone by connecting their phone to their AC
(probably via a phone app.)

I read that Go is usually used in the communication layer of data communication, so I assume that it's because Go was designed
to automatically process information. I'm not sure if that's accurate, but it's my interpretation!
