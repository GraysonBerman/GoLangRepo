In order to install Go and start programming, you should probably watch one of the YouTube videos below that shows you each step.
Unfortunately, you're stuck with a text file I've written to explain it.

I would really recommend reading this: https://golang.org/doc/install instead.
Use this video if you want to set up go on  mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTDOW8UbKjQ

There are a few steps...
1) Install the Go pkg at https://golang.org/dl/ - select the version that is right for your OS.
2) Set up the proper directory. You should set it to c:\go. You will be able to navigate there via terminal.
If you don't set the filepath to c:\go, you need to set your GOROOT to your selected Go directory.
3) Add subdirectories called go/bin, go/src, and go/pkg

Definitely watch the videos. We finagled it until we succeeded.
