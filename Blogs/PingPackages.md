We used the package at this address for our ping commands: https://godoc.org/github.com/sparrc/go-ping

In terminal, type  'go get github.com/sparrc/go-ping' and you'll be able to download the package for the ping project.

It took us a while to figure out how to import the ping package. We tried downloading it manually from github.
We also tried using go get (address).
We had an issue setting up our go file path and GOROOT.

The language is still under development and it's not easy to install. 
Once you download Go and set up the proper file paths, things will run a lot more smoothly. We had to refer to 
more YouTube videos to make it work. Again, we did a lot of trial-and-error.

It would be best if we give you an in-person demo of our project rather than have you set up the go directories.
