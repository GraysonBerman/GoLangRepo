Go loops are weird.

Unlike other high-level programming languages, Go only has one looping mechanism.
Go exclusively uses for loops.
For loops can be exactly like other languages, such as for(i = 0; i < variable; i++){ ... }
They can also be used without a condition to loop infinitely. These loops must be broken with a "break" or "return (value)"

There are more ways to deal with looping using for, but I haven't learned about them yet and I'll have to learn later.

Go looks like its designed to be simple. So far, I've seen the simplification of syntax 
(not needing semi colons) and using for loops for all looping. Wild.
