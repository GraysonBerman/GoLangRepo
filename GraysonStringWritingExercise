Exercise: String Rewriting
Rules:
  ab -> ba
  ba -> ab
  aa ->
  b ->
  
  To reduce the strings 'abba' and 'bababa' we can apply any of the rules.
  For the first string 'abba' I'll rewrite it using ab->ba, ba-->ab, and then aa -> .
  abba -> baba -> baab -> bb
  For the second string 'bababa', I'll rewrite it using b -> and a-> 
  bababa -> ababa -> aaba -> aaa --> aa -> a --> 
  
  The ARS is not terminating because you can rewrite the strings indefinitely. If you use the two rules ab->ba and ba->ab
  infinitely many times, there isn't any reduction. It's only rewriting.
